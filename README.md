## Prerequisites

1. Watch the **video tutorials about how to work with Github**
2. If you don't have one, **create a Github account** (you should have one from when you register your team for the group project) and **send me an email with your username**, so that I can invite you to the platform for our module
3. Make sure that you have a **text editor** on your machine. Notepad (in Windows), TextEdit (for Macs) or gedit (for Linux) work just fine. Alternative editors are Visual Studio Code, Atom, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs. Please choose one and, if needed, install it.
4. Install Github Desktop, and use it as the video tutorials explain.

## Tasks

1. **Check on Github if there are open pull requests. If there are some, choose one and merge it into the master branch.**
If there are conflicts, try and follow these instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/ 
2. **If there are any problems in doing that, open a new issue**. 
3. Clone this repository on you machine. You will be seeing the content in the ```master``` branch.
4. Create a new branch with your Surrey username (the first 7 letters in your Surrey email, something like am00343).
5. Open the ```zombiestory.txt``` file with a text editor. *IMPORTANT: do not use Word for editing the file, it needs to be edited with a simple text editor.*
6. Write your contribution to the story.
7. Commit your changes. Publish your branch on Github. 
8. Open a pull request for your changes. Name the pull request with your Surrey username. 

## Additional rules

1. No obscenity, hate speech, insults, vulgarity, and the usual suspects.
2. There MUST be zombies.
3. Do not use real names.
4. The story is narrated in first person. Don't kill the narrator!
