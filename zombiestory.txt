It has been a few days that I can't go out of the apartment. Too dangerous. But I'm running out of food and water, so I will have to take the risk.

First things first. I need to make sure that there are no walkers just out of the door. 
I look out the door and sure enough there is nothing out there. I turn around and pick up my weapon of choice... the trusty frying pan.

there’s no chance I’m cooking eggs on this again
