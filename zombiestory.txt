It has been a few days that I can't go out of the apartment. Too dangerous. But I'm running out of food and water, so I will have to take the risk.

First things first. I need to make sure that there are no walkers just out of the door.
I look out the door and sure enough there is nothing out there. I turn around and pick up my weapon of choice... the trusty frying pan.

When I left the house, I tried to go to the nearest place possible looking out for the walkers. I managed to get to the garage at the end of the road safely but walkers surrounded me inside. It was still dripping in blood from yesterdays expedition.
I gripped onto the frying pan tightly and was ready for a scrap.
It was still covered in blood from yesterdays expedition. I was starting to question my choice of cooking vessel and pondered whether a wok or a skillet might have been able to do some more damage.

Nevertheless, my only mission now is to try and find food. I mean, what is the point of having my frying pan if I can't cook anything with it? 

My wife and daughter had already been turned. 

I couldn't focus on what I'd lost, I had to concentrate on surviving another day=======
I so tried to leave the garage, and decided it was now or never, i needed to make my way to the shops on Stoughten Road. Little did i know that the zombies were waiting outside. I so ran as fast as i could, trying to get some distance between myself and the zombies before they could react.

Suddenly the zombies started running towards me.

Nevertheless, my only mission now is to try and find food. I mean, what is the point of having my frying pan if I can't cook anything with it?

My wife and daughter had already been turned. Which makes gathering resources easier. Things have been looking bleak ever since I left the apartment.

I was scared from the loss of my family... It was all i could think about. But i couldn't dwell, i will have plenty of time to mourn when i reach the safezone...

But will I ever get to the safe zone and will I eventually be safe? I hope I find others like me that have survived too. I don’t think I can do this alone.

Night was coming... I needed to find food and shelter...

I find out on the radio that there is a survivor's camp very nearby. It is guarded by military so it should be save. So I start to make my way over there.

On the way I come across another survivor in dissaray, who's going in the direction I came from

I stopped to say hi but he just stared at me, holding a shotgun in one hand and a knife in the other.

The thought of the safezone was the only thing keeping me going, but doubt entered my mind, what if it wasn't safe?

This knife could take life but that's already been taken from my wife.

Oh well, what else do I have to lose, other than my frying pan?

This knife could take life but that's already been taken from my wife. 


The memory of my wife was the only thing keeping me going, keeping me sane.

At least she has escaped all this carnage...

Hesitation was something I could not afford but paranoia filled my mind, as I continue to find safety, a metallic smell in the air and the sound of nothingness in the distance. 

Then I heard a clang. Metal slowly scraping eerily across the ground.

A zombie jumped out from the other side of the metal door and was trying to bite me. At the moment just before it could reach me, my body reacted automatically and hit the zombie using my frying pan, pieces of rotten flesh and drips of brown body liquid are splashed all over the ground. This was the first time for me to really destroy a zombie, it was disgushing, I vommited. But I know I have no time to spare in here, I have to move on to survive.

Gathering all my strength, I continue my journey to find food... Ah I'm craving pizza.

I run towards the safezone with my mouth stuffed with pizza.

As I continue to make my way to the safezone I see a Dominos. Do I risk getting pizza?

I choose to take the risk. As I cautiously enter I see a zombie rolling the dough my pizza toppings will go on. I feel sick.

I silently snuck behind the counter, hiding behind the stacks of empty pizza boxes.  I crouched and observed him for a while, then I silently snuck behind him and hit the zombie using my frying pan again.


The zombie squealed and whined in pain as I hit it, but I was too weak to kill the disgusting creature. 
The Zombie became enraged and knocked down the stack of pizza boxes

After hitting the zombie 3 times with the frying pan I realised that it had done nothing but aggrevate it, causing it to swipe at me.

Wait rolling dough? I look again to make sure it was a zombie I hit.

No way , does a zombie smell like strawberry? The substance that came out of the head was fresh human blood.

I dodged out of the way and ran as the zombie came after me.
My mind was going to blow off as I was trying to think of how I will be able to escape from the zombie. I even thought that I would put an end to my own life instead of having to suffer the torture of being killed by a zombie. But then the thought of my wife and daughter came into my mind and that made me think clearly and that I should fight for me just like I had fought for them. I needed to act fast and cleverly. As I was running in the streets, I saw some mud and I thought that by getting in the mud would change my scent and that would distract the zombie and gain me some time into finding a hiding spot. My plan worked and finally the zombie had lost me.

I thought I was in the clear, but suddenly… I heard a rustle in the bush, who was watching me?

Turned out it was just a few filthy rats feasting on what looked like an old rotten corpse of our hometown pizza delivery guy. Had I had more time to think at that moment, I would have realised my sense of smell grew dull to dead bodies in such a short time frame (hence only rats’ noises caught my attention), but I did not possess that luxury. All I came up with was to smash the corpse’s head in with my frying pan, not only to somewhat satisfy my lust for revenge on that brat for always delivering my pizzas late, but also to prevent another cliche zombie screamer moment in my already miserable life. I still wonder what would a walker with living rats on him look like.
In any case, I took off in my endless search for pizza yet again. 

Another zombie jumps out of the bush, but there is no need to panic. This zombie surely can't match me in a foot race...

I was wrong, it raised its hand and sprinted towards me. I whizzed across the street and ran into the first shop that seemed to be safe.

I stumbled inside the shop, gasping for breath. I finally felt safe, boy was I wrong... What I saw next I could never have prepared for...

It was the king of all zombies. Exactly what I had been warned about!

I was face-to-face with my worst nightmare. In a state of panic, I turned and left the shop only to be faced by several more zombies on the street. I was doomed. 

Each footstep shook the ground beneath my feet. Each swing of its arms crashed through the walls. The building's foundation begin to shake. I had to escape, but I knew that any move I made would alert the beast. 

On closer inspection, the zombie king was actually Stan Lee! I thought he looked a bit too fresh. Luckily I was in the comic section and grabbed a Batman comic and threw it at him causing Stan Zomblee to writhe in pain.

Having got the distraction I needed, I dived through the glass window and back on the street. So, pub?
I started running towards a forest in oerder to escape. At first, the rest of the zombies started following me but they couldn't match my speed. I managed to get away but I knew that they could pick up my scent, so I had to act as fast as I could.

I took shelter in an abandoned shed and locked the doors shut.   

Being locked in the shed, i had no other choice that thinking of a fast and effective way to disappear. Zombies where approaching, i had no time at all. But i kept my focus, something deep inside me kept telling me that at the end of the day I would survive. And then the unthinkable happened. A huge earthquake took place. The whole shed was moving. I had no idea what was happening outside.


I took shelter in an abandoned shed and locked the doors shut.   


I knew that the zombies could easily break the door, so I wasn't safe there. I had to think fast but I was still hungry.

I quickly looked around the shed and saw a perfeclty cooked steak with chips, still piping hot, sitting on a plate on the table, as if by a God send. I almost cried with happiness. The tears got stronger as I made my way over to it and realised there was even a bottle of ketchup on the shelf above. Maybe if I was going to die... I would die happy. A strong crashing brought me out of my thoughts. I rolled my eyes in annoyance. I was not going to die in vain, especially if the zombies weren't even going to let me have a last meal in peace. I spotted an axe in the corner of the shed and snatched it up. It was go time.

I looked to my right and see a hammer... not the most practical weapon but it'll do for now. Besides, maybe I can block some windows using it.

I knew that the zombies could easily break the door, so I wasn't safe there. I had to think fast but I was still hungry...

I want to find the way out, so I kick the door again.

No luck. I was starting to run out of time, the zombies had piled up by the door at this point, blocking my only way out. Grabbing the plate of steak and chips I prepare my escape, only to hear the voice of another human say, "put down my steak and chips".

I shouted back "No it's my steak now". 

Now i have two things to worry about: Zombies and an angry man trying to fight me for a steak.

Worried about my friends and family, I drive over to my Mum's house, kill my stepdad who had been bitten by a zombie, and go to pick up my friends, with the plan to brew it over in the Winchester. In order to get there, we must impersonate zombies.

When i make it to the winchester i see that all my friends have also been bitten by zombies except for one
